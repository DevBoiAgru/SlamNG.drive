### Check it out on [itch.io](https://devboiagru.itch.io/slamngdunk)

Beware! It is pretty scuffed. Blueprints aren't the cleanest, and folder structure is not the best. It wasn't supposed to be perfect. Nonetheless, I hope you enjoy!

### If you see any warnings about plugins, you can ignore them because the game's mechanics dont rely on a third party plugin.
